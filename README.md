# Libratone Zipp controller library in Python

This aims to control one or multiple Libratone Zipp speaker with a Python library, potentially usable in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) with [this module](https://github.com/Chouffy/home_assistant_libratone_zipp).

Install it with `pip install python-libratone-zipp` - [pip page](https://pypi.org/project/python-libratone-zipp/)

Tested with Libratone Zipp 1, firmware 809, 879.


## Usage

See example in `CLI.py`. You have to be able to listen to `3333/udp` and `7778/udp`!

Other files:

* `Test_SendCommandReceiveMessage.py` is used to shoot one command for tests purposes.
* `Test_LibratoneMessage.py` is to check LibratoneMessage class against a real message
* `Test_Sockethub.py` is to check if you can recieve information from multiple speakers at once

## Functionality coverage

I'm currently happy with this coverage, so don't expect any updates other than maintenance.  
The only thing I'm very interested is defining Favorites!
